# RobbiAdam-EndlessRunner-1st-
Platformer Endless Run game

my second game that i made.
what do i learn from making this :

Lack input buffer for easier input (jumping and sliding).
Difficulty increases as game progressing.
UI pivot to keep the UI intact if the resolution change.

i still don't know how to avoid error to build on webGL
